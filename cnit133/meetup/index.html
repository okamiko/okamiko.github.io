<h1>AWS Security Training Meetup/EventBrite Group</h1>
<img src="aws_security_training_ucsf.jpg" alt="aws_security_training_picture" height="300" width="500">
<p> The goal of this meetup was an introduction to AWS and AWS Security. It wasn't much of a "meetup", but instead UCSF employees, including me, who were getting trained on AWS and AWS security. We went over what IAM(Identity and Access Management) is and also ran labs on xubuntu using virtualbox, so everyone ran the labs on the same environment. We touched upon concepts such as S3 Buckets, AWS Serverless Security, Cloudtrail, CloudWatch, VPC, EC2 Instances, Logging, Network Security, CMKs, and KMS.
</p>
<p> I got a lot of exposure to AWS cloud and a high level overview of how the cloud works. I also learned a lot more about my company and their long term goals.</p>
<p> We met twice at UCSF Mission Bay from 8-5pm in room 1401. </p>
