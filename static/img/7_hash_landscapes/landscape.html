      This PCG creates an ocean landscape with dolphins and boats. If the wave is high, the boats go flying and the dolphins jump!
      Using Adam/Isaac's original tiles, I changed their colors and added happy little boats and dolphins on them with Paint 3D. I was
      inspired by my first experimentations with the assignment, where I made tiles move up and down like ocean waves with the millis() function.
